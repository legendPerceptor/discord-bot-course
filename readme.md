# Discord Bot Building

In this repo, we walk though the process of building a Discord Bot.

## Get Started

First of all, we want to configure the workspace with all the code formatting, prettier, typescript config, etc.

```bash
yarn add -D prettier eslint typescript @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser
```

> If you opened this repo, since there is a package.json file, you can install all the dependencies with  `yarn install`.

`.nvmrc` is a Node.js version control configuration that is used by NVM. You can use `nvm use` to select the node version configured in this project.
